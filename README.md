You must have heard about "World trends", "India trends" and more localized trends right? But do you really care about these trending topics? Most of these topics dont really reveal whats happening around you. Besides, these tweets are clustered based on geolocation. But your "interests" might be spread across the globe. Well, you see, thats where Tweebuzz comes in. It is an application that aims to provide a personalized trending list. As the saying goes, "Tell me your friends and I'll tell you who are!". Instead of considering tweets from a geolocation, wouldnt it be more intuitive to look at your friends' tweets and find out the whats trending?  Well, thats exactly what I've done, plus some extra graph theoritic masala to go with it.

Usage: 
$ python hello.py
